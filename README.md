# Python-EDA
Exploratory data analysis with python to discover insights

This project presents a structured approach to data cleaning and initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) for a demographic dataset. Using Python, pandas, and numpy, the notebook prepares data for machine learning by addressing common data quality issues such as inconsistent formatting and unclear column names. This step-by-step process ensures a high-quality dataset ready for advanced analytics or predictive modeling tasks.

Project Structure
Data Loading: Imports CSV data files to initialize the dataset.
Data Cleaning: Applies transformations, column renaming, and formatting improvements.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Displays data structure, basic statistics, and potential anomalies.

Data Cleaning Workflow
Column Renaming: Standardizes column names to improve readability and consistency.
Data Type Conversion: Ensures correct data types for efficient processing.
Handling Missing Values: Identifies and prepares strategies for missing data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Summarizes key metrics for numerical and categorical columns.
Detects outliers and distributions to inform further cleaning or transformations.
